Claritev Earnings Call Transcript 2025 Q2

Travis Dalton, President and Chief Executive Officer, Claritiv Corporation: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter twenty twenty five earnings call. I’ve been eagerly awaiting this call to share my excitement around our achievements during the second quarter and, more importantly, the forward momentum we’re building for the remainder of the year and beyond. We’re halfway through 2025, and Claritiv is truly delivering in the year of the turn, as you can see from our earnings release this morning, with year on year revenue growth in 2025 supporting our full year guidance raise. I want to start off the call reiterating our guiding principles: clarity of purpose, alignment of talent and focus on results and how they shape the value we deliver to our clients as a fit for growth organization and allow us to think big when it comes to the health care ecosystem.
These are driving the results you are seeing in supporting our full year expectations and the way up heading into next year. I will then walk through our market verticals and share key highlights for each. Finally, before turning the call over to Doug for a CFO update, I will provide some updates on our digital transformation, which is driving accelerated product development. We’re pleased with our improved results and are building on the foundation of clarity alignment and focus heading into the second half of twenty twenty five and 2026. We’re clear on our purpose to make health care more affordable and transparent for all and thrilled with our new brand launch and progress.
We have aligned the organization for growth around six market segments, five of which are new focus areas and continue to attract world class technology, AI and sales talent. Finally, we are focused on our improved operating model and metrics, some of which you are starting to see in our reporting externally.
