Operator: Good afternoon and welcome to the Q4 earnings call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.

CEO: This quarter, we advanced our Vision 2030 program. Operating costs declined sequentially as automation and cloud migration reduced data center spend. We expect a 10 to 15 percent net reduction in run-rate costs over the next 18 months.

CFO: Revenue was softer than expected in Europe due to channel inventory normalization. However, U.S. demand remained resilient. EBITDA margin compressed by 80 basis points given FX and freight headwinds.

CTO: Technology investments centered on our data platform and generative AI copilots for our sales teams. Early pilots improved conversion by 6 percent, and we plan broader rollout next quarter. We expanded our Oracle Cloud Infrastructure footprint to improve scalability and reduce latency.

COO: On products, we launched two mid-market SKUs with healthy initial orders. Supply chain conditions improved and lead times are normalizing. Customer satisfaction scores remained above 90.

CFO: Turning to guidance, we expect Q1 revenue growth of 2 to 4 percent sequentially, with gross margin stable. Capex will increase modestly to support cloud migrations.

Q&A: Analysts asked about competitive dynamics and market share. We see stable share overall, with strength in government verticals offsetting weakness in EMEA retail.
